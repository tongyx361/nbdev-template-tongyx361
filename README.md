# `nbdev` Template @tongyx361


<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! -->

## Setup

We recommend:

- using [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/miniconda) to set up the
  **basic Python environment** and install some **non-Python packages**
  like `git-lfs` when **without the root permission**;
- using [`pip`](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/#) to manage the **Python
  packages** because some packages are **only available via `pip`**.

Run the following commands to setup the **basic environment** and
**install most dependencies**:

``` shell
git clone https://github.com/tongyx361/nbdev-template-tongyx361.git
cd nbdev-template-tongyx361
# Configure settings.ini, environment.yml, pkg_name
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate myenv
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

For common users/developers, please just run the following command the
install the `dart-math` package:

``` shell
pip install -e "."
```

For intended contributors, we recommend installing the package with the
`dev` extras and setting up the pre-commit hooks by running:

``` shell
pip install -e ".[dev]"
pre-commit install
```
